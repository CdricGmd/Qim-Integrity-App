        <p>This repository represents my final-year major project in Telecom SudParis 'High Tech Imaging'.</p>

<p>The subject was proposed by Mihai Mitrea and Marwen Hasnaoui, researchers at <a href="http://artemis.telecom-sudparis.eu/">Institut Mines – Telecom ; ARTEMIS</a>.</p>

<p>The application received the Jury's favorite app price at CodeFest Challenge Intel 2014.</p>

<a name="objectives" class="anchor" href="#objectives"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h2>

<p>The main objective is to implement a technique asserting that the content of an image has not been modified (Integrity), with constraints: </p>

<ul>
<li>Watermarking: insert a message, detect and decide if the content has been modified.</li>
<li>Transparency: the insertion must be transparent (according to human eyes)</li>
<li>Robustness: the message must be recoverable if the image has been requantized</li>
<li>Weakness: the decision must detect modification on the content (objects, shapes, ...) of the image</li>
</ul><p>The watermarking is based on QIM and ST-DM techniques to insert signature in the image based on its content.</p>

<h2>
<a name="watermaking-library" class="anchor" href="#watermaking-library"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Watermaking library</h2>

<p>The Watermarking library (C/C++) uses and requires <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV library (under BSD License)</a> for image processing. It provides functions for:</p>

<ul>
<li>signature generation based on image content</li>
<li>image watermaking insertion and detection</li>
<li>integrity checking comparing detected and computed signatures</li>
<li>similarity measures (PSNR, SSIM, IF, NCC)</li>
</ul><p>The signature insertion generate a "key file", which is needed for the detection.</p>

<h2>
<a name="android-application--qim-app" class="anchor" href="#android-application--qim-app"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Android Application : Qim App</h2>

<p><em>Protect the content of you images with an invisible watermarking solution</em></p>

<p>Qim App allows to check if the content of an image has been modified. An invisible "mark" is inserted in the image and a "key" file is generated. The inserted mark does not alter the appearance of the image. The Check function use the key file to assert if a marked image has been modified.</p>

<p>Qim App is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdricgmd.qimnavigationapp">Google Play</a> for free.</p>

<p><strong>Technical challenges</strong> (as part of Télécom SudParis HighTech Imaging major):</p>

<ul>
<li>use a native library in Android : The Android application uses the QimWatermaking native library (through JNI) to enable marking and integrity checking of images. Moreover it is an example of native code re-usage following a write-once strategy.</li>
<li>demonstrate and evaluate performances of the library on lightweight devices</li>
<li>give access to the library features <em>via</em> an easy and confortable user experience</li>
</ul><p><strong>Features</strong> : </p>

<ul>
<li>mark an image loaded from the Image Library</li>
<li>mark an image taken with the camera</li>
<li>share the marked image and the key file</li>
<li>check the integrity given an image loaded from the Image Library and a key file loaded from the device's storage

<ul>
<li>it gives an "integrity score" between 0.0 and 1.0</li>
<li>a score over 0.9 assert that the content has not been modifies</li>
<li>a score under 0.7 asser that the integrity has been broken</li>
<li>intermediate scores depend on image and attacks on content / format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>How to mark an image ?</strong>
1. On the instructions screen open an image from the library (memory card icon) or take a picture with the camera (camera icon).
2. Then, swipe to the "Mark" panel and click to insert a mark in the image and generate the key file.
3. Once process is done, insertion time and similarity measures (PSNR, SSIM) are displayed.
4. You can share the marked image and the key file in the application via the <i>share</i> button;</p>

<p><strong>How to check if a marked image has been modified ?</strong>
1. On the instructions screen load a marked image from the library (memory card icon) and a key file (key icon).
2. Then, swipe to the "Check" panel and click to launch the process.
3. The detection algorithm returns a score between 0 and 1 : over 0.90 we consider that the content integrity has not been broken, under 0.80 we can say that the content has been modified.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> the marked images are stored in "Pictures/IntegrityApp" and the key files are stores in "Download/IntegrityApp".</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Qim App needs <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opencv.engine">OpenCV Manager</a>, free on Google Play.</li>
<li>Loading a key file stored on the terminal may require a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=file%20manager&amp;c=apps">file manager application</a>, like OI File Manager, free on Google Play.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Screenshots:</strong></p>
